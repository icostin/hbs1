Description:
* this project provides a library implementing various basic services
  (such as memory allocation, multi-threading support, file system
  access, file I/O, etc) using host''s native functions
* the library complements the interfaces defined in c41
* a second product of this project is a static library for command-line
  applications which initialises the interfaces defined by c41 and
  provided by hbs1, so that the user program can only rely on c41 helper
  functions and the initialised c41 interfaces
